# Environment Variable Configuration

Install Doctor can provision most of the system without additional input. However, you can take advantage of more features if you pass in variables with API keys which are used to leverage free cloud services.

For more details on how you can customize your deployment, check out the [Customization](https://install.doctor/customization) and the [Integrating Secrets](https://install.doctor/customization/secrets) documentation.
