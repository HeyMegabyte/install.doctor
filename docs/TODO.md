# TODOs

This page outlines various projects and tasks that we are currently working on. Creating a GitHub issue for each of these items would be overkill.

* Configure Navi to automatically download and use the best cheat repositories
* Finish TS from 1400 stars

## Upstream

The following items are things we would like to include into the Install Doctor system but are waiting on upstream changes.

* [Actions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Actions) adds a wide-variety of actions that you can utilize with the macOS Shortcuts app. It is currently only available via the macOS app store. Requested a Homebrew Cask [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Actions/issues/127).
* [Color Picker](https://github.com/sindresorhus/System-Color-Picker) is an improved color picker app available on macOS. It is currently only available via the macOS app store. Requested Homebrew Cask [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/System-Color-Picker/issues/32).

* Wait for Homebrew install option for [Warpgate](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate)
* Wait for https://github.com/hocus-dev/hocus to get out of alpha for VM management
