## Pending

* [Actions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Actions) adds a wide-variety of actions that you can utilize with the macOS Shortcuts app. It is currently only available via the macOS app store. Requested a Homebrew Cask [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Actions/issues/127).
* [Color Picker](https://github.com/sindresorhus/System-Color-Picker) is an improved color picker app available on macOS. It is currently only available via the macOS app store. Requested Homebrew Cask [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/System-Color-Picker/issues/32).
* Consider integrating [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) which can be used in combination with mods to generate ChatGPT responses locally
* Wait for Homebrew install option for [Warpgate](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate)
* Wait for https://github.com/hocus-dev/hocus to get out of alpha for VM management

## Premium Software Recommendations

### macOS

* [Dato](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1470584107) - World clocks and calendar menu bar application available for macOS. It is a better, paid alternative to the free version of Clockr which is currently installed using the default configuration of Install Doctor.
* [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/) is the best virtualization manager / platform available on macOS
