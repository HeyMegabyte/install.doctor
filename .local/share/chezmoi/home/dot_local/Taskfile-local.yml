# This is your local Taskfile.yml file. You can define tasks and scripts while leveraging some of the nifty
# features of https://taskfile.dev. You can safely place your scripts here and they will be combined with
# a veteran stack of Taskfile.yml files. You can access the tasks defined here by running
# `run local:default` for example. You must keep all the tasks in this file without including other files
# because the main Taskfile.yml is a symlinked one. Anyway, try `run local:default`.
