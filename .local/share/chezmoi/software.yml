# `softwarePackages` is a map of possible package managers to use while installing a program. The installer will
# look at the `installerPreference` variable (bottom of file) and find the first package manager that is in the package's possible
# installation method and then use that. It is also sensitive to the type of operating system so a package with
# only `apt` defined will not install on macOS.
#
# Everything should be fairly straight forward. Take a look at the `installerPreference` for a list of package managers. If a package
# has dependencies, the dependencies are defined under the `_deps` key. All of the `_deps` should also be defined in the
# `softwarePackages` map. The installer will check for the presence of the package's key in the PATH. If the package's key
# does not match the executable's name, then the `_bin` key can be defined so that the installer will look at that instead.
#
# Full example of a softwarePackage:
# altair:
#   _bin: ng                                          # Instead of checking if the object key (altair) is in the PATH, check if "ng" is in the PATH and only proceed if it is not available
#   _deps:                                            # Any piece of data can be a string or array. _deps will take each dep and run that through the installer first
#     - angular-cli
#   _docker: docker run --rm bannmann/docker-cheat    # Command that the _bin value should alias to (similar to Whalebrew)
#   _when: |                                          # Run the script defined with _when and only proceed if it exits with a 0
#     test -f /usr
#   _pre: |
#     echo "_pre allows you to define a script that runs before the installation"
#   _post:brew:debian: |

Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs).
