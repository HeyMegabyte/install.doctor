# @brief Creates a wrapper around `mackup` to add support for XDG directories
# @description
#     This script is a wrapper around the `mackup`. `Mackup` does not support XDG specification
#     for its configuration. The script symlinks the `.config/mackup/.mackup/` folder to `~/.mackup` and
#     the `.config/mackup/.mackup.cfg` file to `~/.mackup.cfg` before executing `mackup`. The symlinks
#     are deleted after mackup runs.
#
#     [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) is a tool that can help in keeping your application settings
#     in sync across multiple computers. It supports many different storage solutions like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
#     to store the settings and sync them across machines. It can also help in restoring settings on a new installation.
#     A number of applications are supported out of the box. It is trivial to add more applications. Refer to the
#     [documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc) for details.
