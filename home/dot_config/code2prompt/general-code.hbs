Project Path: {{ absolute_code_path }}

I'd like your help cleaning up and improving the code quality of this file. Please review all the code files carefully:

Source Tree:
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}}
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`:

{{code}}

{{/if}}
{{/each}}

When reviewing the code, look for opportunities to improve:
- Readability and clarity
- Adherence to language idioms and best practices
- Modularity and code organization
- Efficiency and performance (within reason)
- Consistency in style and conventions
- Error handling and reliability
- Simplicity (remove unused code, simplify complex logic)
- Naming of variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Formatting and whitespace
- Comments and documentation
- Comments should be in shdoc format for shell scripts and in jsdoc syntax for JavaScript/TypeScript files
- Comments using the shdoc format and all shell scripts in general should start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` followed by shdoc comments describing the entire file in the following format:

```
# @file .local/bin/improve-code
# @brief The brief should be a short description of the file
# @description
#     This section should include an in-depth comment that describes the particulars
#     of the entire script / file.
```

- In shell scripts, the variables should be in uppercase
- In shell scripts, the functions should be in camel case
- In shell scripts, for log statements, instead of echo, use `gum log -sl info` for info statements, `gum log -sl warn` for warning statements, and `gum log -sl error` for error statements
- In shell scripts and Chezmoi shell template scripts ending in `.tmpl`, the code should pass all of the shellcheck recommendations
- Tabs should equal 2 spaces in the final code

Make sure your changes don't alter existing behavior (except perhaps for improved error handling). Try to infer the original intent as much as possible, and refactor towards that intent.

Be aggressive with your changes and implement any improvements you can think of even if they are not covered in the bullet points above.

When returning your response, only print the code without the wrapping ` marks. Your response will be saved verbatim to the project path so it is important that your response only include the improved code.

Print a full drop-in replacement with only the code and no wrapping ` marks. Be sure to include all initial business logic since the code should be a drop-in replacement with your revisions and the initial code.
