# @file Generate Missing Public SSH Keys
# @brief Attempts to create missing public SSH keys for all private keys that are missing a public key file
# @description
#     **Currently disabled.** Using private SSH keys, you can generate the corresponding public key. This script ensures that any SSH private key
#     that does not have a matching `.pub` public key file has one generated.
#
#     This script is intended to automatically generate the public key from the decrypted private key but it does not seem to be working
#     properly so the code is commented out. Pull requests are welcome.
