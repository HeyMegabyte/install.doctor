# @brief Pre-installs the VIM plugins from their git sources
# @description
#     This script pre-installs the VIM plugins defined in [`.chezmoidata.yaml`](https://github.com/megabyte-labs/install.doctor/tree/master/home/.chezmoidata.yaml)
#     so that VIM does not have to do anything on its first launch.

### Run the VIM plugin install routine
if command -v vim > /dev/null; then
    vim +PlugInstall +qall
fi
{{ end -}}
