# @file Homebrew / Xcode Tools Installation
# @brief Ensures Xcode tools are installed on macOS and ensures Homebrew is installed on either Linux or macOS
# @description
#     This script ensures macOS has tools like `git` by installing the Xcode command-line developer tools if they are
#     not already installed. Then, on both Linux and macOS, it ensures Homebrew is installed.
#
#     ## Homebrew Requirement
#
#     Install Doctor relies on Homebrew for many tools that are currently only available via Homebrew. Removing the dependency
#     would be a nice-to-have but there are currently no plans for supporting systems without Homebrew installed.
