# @brief Applies the system `fail2ban` jail configuration and then restarts the service
# @description
#     Fail2ban is an SSH security program that temporarily bans IP addresses that could possibly be
#     attempting to gain unauthorized system access. This script applies the "jail" configuration
#     located at `home/private_dot_ssh/fail2ban/` to the system location. It then enables and restarts
#     the `fail2ban` configuration.

### Restart fail2ban
function restartFail2Ban() {
    if [ -d /Applications ] && [ -d /System ]; then
        # macOS
        logg info 'Enabling the `fail2ban` Homebrew service'
        brew services start fail2ban
    else

### Update the jail.local file if environment is not WSL

        sudo cp -f "$HOME/.ssh/fail2ban/jail.local" /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
        restartFail2Ban
    elif [ -d /usr/local/etc/fail2ban ]; then
        logg info 'Copying ~/.ssh/fail2ban/jail.local to /usr/local/etc/fail2ban/jail.local'
        sudo cp -f "$HOME/.ssh/fail2ban/jail.local" /usr/local/etc/fail2ban/jail.local
        restartFail2Ban
    else
        logg warn 'Both the /etc/fail2ban (Linux) and the /usr/local/etc/fail2ban (macOS) folder do not exist'
